                         <p>My name is Alexander and I came from a very exotic country called Moldova. It's not, but not that many people heard of it. They say Seattleites bleed rain, well, prior to moving here I bled wine. That's what Moldova is famous for. It is also known for the export of its citizens and I am one of those lucky people since 2014. Since then, I've thoroughly gotten to know my new home- the United States of America. </p>
